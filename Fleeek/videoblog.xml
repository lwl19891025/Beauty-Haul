<title>A Ten-Minute Habit To Take Back Control And Change Your Life</title>
<p>It was that time of the year again that I hated. My birthday.</p>
<p>My mentor took me out for lunch at my favorite vegetarian restaurant that doubles as a Buddhist temple. Over some crispy tofu, my mentor asked me why I hated birthdays. I explained to him that age is just a number in my mind and I don’t value the day I was born.</p>
<p>I probably shouldn’t have said any of those words because what followed was an onslaught of abuse, some of the best advice I’ve been given and a ten-minute hack to take back control of your life.</p>
<br/>
<p>My mentor first told me that I had to stop being childish and celebrate my birthday. Sometimes we all need a kick in the face to wake us up from the lies we tell ourselves. He said that by not celebrating my birthday, I was essentially saying that my life didn’t matter and wasn’t worth acknowledging.</p>
